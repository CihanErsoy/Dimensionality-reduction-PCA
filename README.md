# Dimensionality-reduction-PCA
Principle Component Analysis is implemented as a Dimensionality Reduction Method for learning purposes. Includes visualization.

This repository contains basic concept of dimensionality reduction using principle component analysis. 
I used wine dataset. You can download and work on this dataset by calling it from scikit learn library's dataset module. 
This code has been prepared mainly for a blog post which has been written in Turkish. I included that blog post as a rich text format(rtf) in Turkish as well.
I have used different visualization techniques to facilitate the understanding of decorrelation which is applied in the background during the dimensionality reduction process. 
I paid close attention to writing exhaustive commentaries under each cell to avoid uncertanties.
